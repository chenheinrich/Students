# Things to download/sign-up/learn

## 1. Visual Studio Code
  - We use VS Code as editor for collaborative code, so that spaces and tabs are treated uniformly. (It is also just the most recommended editor around here.) 
  - Some tips: from terminal, `code script.py` would open the script in question easily.
  - Add the Python extension and others to help you when you code.
  
## 2. Visual Studio Code Insider 
  - Visual Studio Code Insider lets you edit code and view plots on clusters just like on your laptop (i.e. it has an internal ssh client) -- highly recommended. 
  - Follow instructions to setup the [remote development extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) . They also have a great page on how to [setup ssh key](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_improving-your-security-with-a-dedicated-key) based authentification.
  
## 3. GitHub
  - We often collaborate using Git repositories for version control, make an account on GitHub to join. 
  - Consult notes in this repo to learn about the standard Git workflow. It is especially important that you adhere to it (e.g. use branches, etc.) to effectively collaborate with others.
  
## 4. Google Python Style Guide
  - We try our best to adhere to [Google's Python Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
  - Get familiar with it, and it will help you code for yourself and others (especially the docstring part).
